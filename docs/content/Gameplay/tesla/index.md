# Tesla Network ⚡

The Tesla Network is a high-tier wireless energy distribution system in PhoenixCore. It allows for the transmission of EU across dimensions using the power of the "Tesla Cloud."

##  Tesla Tower
The **Tesla Tower** is the heart of your wireless network. It acts as the central hub and storage for EU.

- **Structure**: A large multiblock that requires specialized battery components.
- **Capacity**: Determined by the number and tier of Tesla Batteries installed within the tower.
- **Function**: It collects energy from standard GT hatches or Tesla Uplink hatches and makes it available to the network.

##  Tesla Hatches
Hatches are used to interface with the Tesla Network without needing a physical connection to the Tower.

- **Tesla Uplink (Input)**: Siphons energy from your power generation into the Tesla Cloud.
- **Tesla Downlink (Output)**: Broadcasts energy from the Tesla Cloud into your machines.
- **Laser Hatches**: High-frequency energy transmission for extreme power requirements using the **Tesla Optical Collimator** and **Photonic Receptor**.

##  Tesla Binder
The **Tesla Binder** is the primary tool for managing your network.

- **Binding to Player**: `Shift + Right-Click` the air to bind the tool to your personal frequency.
- **Linking Machines**: `Right-Click` a machine with a bound Binder to "Soul-Link" it. This allows the machine to receive energy directly from the cloud without a hatch.
- **Network Management**: `Right-Click` the air with a bound Binder to open the management UI. Here you can see:
    - Total stored energy and capacity.
    - Net input and output flow.
    - A list of all connected devices (Hatches, Soul-Linked machines, and Wireless Chargers).
    - Distance and dimension of connected devices.
    - Highlight specific devices in the world.

##  Soul-Linking
Soul-linking is a unique feature that allows machines to draw power directly from your network frequency. 

1. Bind a **Tesla Binder** to your frequency.
2. `Right-Click` any machine that has an internal energy buffer.
3. The machine will now draw power from the Tesla Tower whenever it has a demand, provided the Tower has enough energy.

##  Wireless Charging
The **Tesla Wireless Charger** is a single-block machine that provides wireless charging to players' armor and held items within its radius, drawing energy from the Tesla Network.
