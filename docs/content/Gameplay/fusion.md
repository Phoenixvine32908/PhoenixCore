# Phoenixware Fusion Mk1 ⚛️

The **Phoenixware Fusion Mk1** is an advanced fusion reactor that pushes the boundaries of energy production. It utilizes high-tier materials and specialized casings to maintain a stable fusion reaction.

## 🌀 The Black Hole Effect
A unique feature of the Phoenixware Fusion Mk1 is the creation of a localized **Black Hole** (gravitational lens) during operation. 

- **Visuals**: When the reactor is active and running a recipe, a high-density singularity forms at the focal point of the reactor's emitters.
- **Lensing**: The singularity causes light to bend around it, creating a "gravitational lensing" effect that distorts the view of the world behind it.
- **Event Horizon**: The center of the singularity is perfectly black, as no light can escape the event horizon.

## 🏗️ Structure
The reactor is a massive multiblock structure. Key components include:

- **Insanely Supercharged Tesla Casings**: Used as the primary containment shielding.
- **Fusion Coils**: High-performance coils required to reach fusion temperatures.
- **Superconducting Coils**: Used for magnetic confinement.
- **Computer Casings**: Provide the necessary processing power for reactor control.
- **Fusion Glass**: Allows for visual monitoring of the reaction core.

## ⚡ Operation
The Phoenixware Fusion Mk1 operates similarly to standard fusion reactors but at a much higher tier (**UIV**).

1. **Fueling**: Inject fusion fuels via fluid hatches.
2. **Pre-heating**: Ensure the reactor has sufficient energy to reach the ignition temperature.
3. **Sustaining**: Once ignited, the reactor will continue to produce vast amounts of EU and localized gravitational effects as long as fuel is supplied.

## ⚛️ Helical Fusion Reactor
The **Helical Fusion Reactor** is another advanced fusion multiblock in PhoenixCore.

- **Visuals**: Features a complex helical plasma render that floats in front of the machine during operation.
- **Dynamic Color**: The plasma color changes based on the active fusion recipe, reflecting the nature of the reaction.
- **LOD Rendering**: The renderer automatically adjusts the detail of the helical effect based on the player's distance to maintain performance.

## 🧪 Alchemical Imbuer
The **Alchemical Imbuer** is a specialized multiblock that bridges the gap between technical chemistry and arcane arts, utilizing **Source** from *Ars Nouveau*.

- **Function**: Used for imbuing materials with Source or extracting Source from various biological and crystalline items.
- **Integration**: Requires an **Arcane Core** and **Sourcelink** within its structure to interface with the magical world.
- **Source Management**: Can be equipped with **Source Input/Output Hatches** to automate the flow of Source energy.
